<p>Last week, on February 1st, our build pipeline noticed a failing test. It showed up that this test, written several weeks ago, in January, passed indeed only in January.</p>

<p>January is the only month that string-concatenated with <code>"1"</code> gives you a valid month — <code>"11"</code>, November. Starting with 1st February, the test made no more sense as <code>"21"</code> is obviously no valid month.</p>

<p>Albeit it was quite easy to fix this “everwinter” bug, the situation demonstrates well how tricky testing time could be. If your tests ever failed when close to midnight, in a leap year, or on a machine in a different time zone, then you know what I am talking about.</p>

<p><em>Test in isolation</em>. I guess you have already heard this statement. It is often understood as isolating units under test from each other. This explanation caused the explosion of mock-based testing. I believe it completely misses the point.</p>

<p>The <strong>tests</strong> should be <strong>isolated from each other</strong>, so they are <strong>independent of execution</strong> order and side-effects. Tests should also be <strong>isolated from environment</strong> specifics, <strong>independent of volatile</strong> and unstable data.</p>

<p>What can be more volatile than ever-in-flux, elusive time? We need to find a way how to control time in our tests.</p>

<h2>Testing Date and Time</h2>

<p>Consider a simple example of placing a new Order:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@Service
class OrderService {

  public Order place(String content) {
    return Order.builder()
      .id(UUID.randomUUID())
      .createdAt(ZonedDateTime.now())
      .content(content)
      .build();
  }
}
</pre>

<p>How can we test that the Order was created at the current time?</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@Test
void order_is_placed_at_current_time() {
  var order = orderService.place("Test");

  assertThat(order.getCreatedAt())
    .isEqualTo(ZonedDateTime.now());
}
</pre>

<p>Nope, this won’t work. There are tools to help us with this tedious task:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
assertThat(order.getCreatedAt())
  .isCloseTo(ZonedDateTime.now(),
    within(1, ChronoUnit.SECONDS));
</pre>

<p>Yes, this will work. But what if the placing takes more than one second? What if even nanoseconds matter?</p>

<p>Sometimes, we need a solution that brings us one hundred percent certainty. Sometimes, we just need to control the clock.</p>

<h2>Mocking the Clock</h2>

<p>An obvious option is mocking. We already <a href="https://blog.ttulka.com/glass-box-testing-does-not-need-mocking" target="_blank">mock almost everything</a> (sadly), so why not mock time as well?</p>

<p>Date and time in Java can be calculated dependently on a <code>java.time.Clock</code> instance:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
var clock = Clock.systemUTC();
var zdt = ZonedDateTime.now(clock);
</pre>

<p>We can use this tactic for our advance:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@Service
class OrderService {

  private final Clock clock = Clock.systemUTC();

  public Order place(String content) {
    return Order.builder()
      .id(UUID.randomUUID())
      .createdAt(ZonedDateTime.now(clock))
      .content(content)
      .build();
  }
}
</pre>

<p>When using the <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#0.2" target="_blank">Mockito inline maker</a> we can easily mock static methods:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
static Clock clock;

@BeforeAll
static void setupClock() {
  clock = Clock.fixed(
      Instant.parse("2020-12-01T10:05:23.653Z"),
      ZoneId.of("Europe/Prague"));

  Mockito.mockStatic(Clock.class)
    .when(Clock::systemUTC).thenReturn(clock);
}

@Test
void order_is_placed_at_current_time() {
  var order = orderService.place("Test");

  assertThat(order.getCreatedAt())
    .isEqualTo(ZonedDateTime.now(clock));
}
</pre>

<p>This will work, but there is a lot of boilerplate code and an amount of black magic going on.</p>

<p>Mocking static methods will definitely impact other tests that use the methods which means that just lost test isolation again. Can we do better?</p>

<h2>Fixing the Clock</h2>

<p>Why not just use the basic Spring feature and inject the clock as a bean dependency?</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@Service
class OrderService {

  private final Clock clock;

  public OrderService(Clock clock) {
    this.clock = clock;
  }

  ...
}
</pre>

<p>Now, when the clock became a dependency of the service, we have to provide a default instance to the Spring context:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@SpringBootApplication
public class ShoppingApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ShoppingApplication.class, args);
  }

  @Bean
  Clock clock() {
    return Clock.systemUTC();
  }
}
</pre>

<p>We can change this instance arbitrarily, like providing a fixed clock for our tests:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@TestConfiguration
class FixedClockConfig {

  @Primary
  @Bean
  Clock fixedClock() {
    return Clock.fixed(
        Instant.parse("2020-12-01T10:05:23.653Z"),
        ZoneId.of("Europe/Prague"));
  }
}

@SpringBootTest(classes = FixedClockConfig.class)
class OrderTests {

  @Autowired
  private Clock clock;

  @Autowired
  private OrderService orderService;

  @Test
  void order_is_placed_at_current_time() {
    var order = orderService.place("Test");

    assertThat(order.getCreatedAt())
      .isEqualTo(ZonedDateTime.now(clock));
  }
}
</pre>

<p>We can use the same test configuration in multiple tests:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@SpringBootTest(classes = ClockConfig.class)
class OrderTests {
  ...
}

@SpringBootTest(classes = ClockConfig.class)
class DeliveryTests {
  ...
}
</pre>

<h2>Controlling the Clock</h2>

<p>When a fixed clock is not enough, we can gain more control by mixing both worlds: injecting a mocked clock:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
@SpringBootTest
class OrderTests {

  @MockBean
  private Clock clock;

  @Autowired
  private OrderService orderService;

  @BeforeEach
  void setupClock() {
    when(clock.getZone()).thenReturn(
        ZoneId.of("Europe/Prague"));
  }

  @Test
  void order_is_placed_at_current_time() {
    when(clock.instant()).thenReturn(
        Instant.parse("2020-12-01T10:05:23.653Z"));

    var order = orderService.place("Test");

    assertThat(order.getCreatedAt())
      .isEqualTo(ZonedDateTime.now(clock));
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We have seen how to test date and time with Spring Boot and Mockito.</p>

<p>Controlling time brings certainty into tests, makes them isolated from the environment, independent, and stable.</p>
