<p>It is 2024, AI has already eaten almost the whole world and we have developed tools that make paradigms from the 60s such as OOP seriously outdated, right? Well, not really.</p>

<p>At least in the mainstream, object-oriented design offers the most beneficial approach for software development from code to system architecture. However, only when done right.</p>

<p>By merely using the keywords <code>object</code> or <code>class</code> we do not create object-oriented code. One can easily write completely non-object-oriented code even in a pretty much object-oriented programming language like Java or C#, but only by employing the principles of OOP can we make our programs genuinely object-oriented.</p>

<p>Although these principles have been well-known for decades they are poorly understood by most developers even today. More and more I see a constant shift to structural programming, a technique much older than OOP itself.</p>

<p>The result is sub-optimally designed systems that are hard to maintain, extend, and reason about. Error-prone, fragile, distributed <a href="/good-and-bad-monolith">monoliths</a> are just one example familiar to many of us.</p>

<p>Knowledge acquired in school is a good foundation, but it is not sufficient. We have to focus on <strong>understanding rather than just knowing</strong>, we must learn principles over practices.</p>

<h2>Principles of Object-Oriented Design and Programming</h2>

<p>Alright, what are the most fundamental principles then?</p>

<p class="definition">An object is defined by its contract.</p>

<p>The contract of an object defines <i>what</i> the object can do, not <i>how</i> it does it. Looking at the object from the outside should not provide any insight into its implementation. The contract must not be violated; the object’s job is to protect its invariants. Business purpose is a solid base for a stable contract.</p>

<p class="definition">Objects are autonomous.</p>

<p>You should never ask an object to provide the information needed for a particular action. Rather, ask the object to perform the action for you. No object can do things to another object. Objects are active entities, they are not passive puppets.</p>

<p class="definition">All data is private.</p>

<p>Objects must hide all data and other details they need to work out a particular business problem. If data is not private, it becomes part of the contract. This is the difference between objects and data structures: objects are solid, data structures are transparent. More formally, we talk about the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">encapsulation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding">information hiding</a>.</p>

<p>These principles may sound simple, but simplicity is often not an easy goal to achieve. Programmers tend toward “smart” solutions rather than simple ones; they, for instance, master OOP practices like encapsulation by using private attributes but violate the principle of information hiding by exposing them via getters and setters.</p>

<p>The list is, of course, not definitive, we can add many others such as composability, all SOLID principles, etc.</p>

<p>However, the three concepts mentioned are paramount, superior to all others, and most difficult to achieve at the same time. Therefore, they are often ignored completely.</p>

<p>Most importantly, they are universally useful on all levels of software development.</p>

<h2>Object-Oriented Microservices</h2>

<p>Nowadays, no technical post would be complete without mentioning <a href="/you-are-not-gonna-need-microservices">microservices</a>, an extremely popular architectural design pattern for building distributed systems.</p>

<p>How does object-oriented design apply in microservices architecture? First of all, let us recall the definition of a (micro)service:</p>

<p class="definition">A service is the technical authority for a specific business capability.</p>

<p>Now, what is a business capability? It is an expression of <i>what</i> business does and can do. Business capabilities are keys to define high-cohesive service boundaries.</p>

<p>It is a particular functionality that carries out a business capability. Functionality defines the system’s behavior.</p>

<p class="definition">A service is autonomous; its ability to function is not controlled or inhibited by other services.</p>

<p>Services are <a href="/monolithic-objects">independent</a>, self-contained, and free from external control and constraint. Services can decide on their own. The more autonomous our services are, the more loosely coupled they are.</p>

<p class="definition">Any piece of data or rule must be owned by only one service.</p>

<p>In other words, a service must encapsulate all data and implementation details it operates upon. We talk about a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture">shared-nothing architecture</a> in which every request is satisfied by a single node.</p>

<p>To summarize it in a few bullet points, a service:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is defined by its capabilities,</li>
	<li>owns its data and rules,</li>
	<li>is fully in control.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this sound familiar? Sure it does! Conceptually, <strong>a service is just an object on the system level</strong>. Technical details differ, but the same ideas apply here.</p>

<p>Understanding principles of object-oriented design will help you build your microservices so that they are easy to maintain, <a href="/how-cohesion-and-coupling-correlate">highly cohesive and loosely coupled</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It is 2024 and we still don’t have a lucid understanding of how to develop our software. The IT industry grows rapidly and requirements change too quickly for us to catch up.</p>

<p>Five decades ago, great principles of object-oriented design and programming were defined and they can still teach us a lot today. We just have to learn and adopt them correctly.</p>

<p>Object-oriented design is a holistic approach. It can be successfully applied to the whole span of problems in software development.</p>

<p>All in all, the principles of object-oriented design and programming are the best we have. And this is not going to change any time soon.</p>

<p>Happy programming!</p>
