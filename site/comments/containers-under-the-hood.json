echo 7340032 > memory.limit_in_bytes
# bash: memory.limit_in_bytes: Permission denied
It would seem there is a cgroup v2 that replaces the limit_in_bytes by memory.max and instead of adding the busybox under the memory cgroup I need to create it under the /sys/fs/cgroup/busybox.
I'm running Ubunt 23.10, in a QEMU VM under aarch64."
