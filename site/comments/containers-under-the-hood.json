`echo 7340032 > memory.limit_in_bytes`
`# bash: memory.limit_in_bytes: Permission denied`
It would seem there is a cgroup v2 that replaces the limit_in_bytes by `memory.max` and instead of adding the busybox under the memory cgroup I need to create it under the /sys/fs/cgroup/busybox.
I'm running Ubuntu 23.10, in a QEMU VM under aarch64.
Also, we need the `cgroup.procs` instead of tasks."
